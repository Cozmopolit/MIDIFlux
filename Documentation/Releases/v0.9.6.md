# MIDIFlux v0.9.6 Release Notes

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Listen Mode: PitchBend Interference Fix
Many MIDI keyboards send a PitchBend center (8192) reset signal immediately before every NoteOn event. The Listen mode's default case was catching this PitchBend — it didn't populate InputType/InputNumber but still stopped listening, so the actual NoteOn arriving milliseconds later was silently missed. Users experienced this as "Listen doesn't capture my button press."

**Fix:**
- Filter out PitchBend center (8192) as noise — return without stopping the listener
- Add explicit handling for previously unhandled event types: PitchBend, ProgramChange, ChannelPressure, and PolyphonicKeyPressure with proper InputType/InputNumber population
- Change the default case from break (stop listening) to return (ignore) for truly unhandled event types like SysEx/Error/Other

## 🔧 Improvements
