# MIDIFlux v0.9.4 Release Notes

## 🎮 Game Controller Usability

### Complete Xbox 360 Controller Demo Profile
The `game-controller-demo.json` example has been replaced with a **complete, production-ready Xbox 360 controller mapping** covering all 15 buttons, 4 thumbstick axes, and 2 triggers (36 mappings total). Users can now load this profile and simply remap the MIDI inputs to match their device — no need to build a controller profile from scratch.

### Game Controller Quickstart Guide
New dedicated walkthrough (`Documentation/User/GameController_Quickstart.md`) that takes users from ViGEm installation to a working MIDI-to-gamepad setup, including a test-first workflow and a reference table of all demo profile mappings.

## 🔧 Improvements

### Action Mapping Dialog UX
Improved the action mapping dialog with better parameter controls and layout for a smoother profile editing experience.

### Documentation Restructured
Documentation reorganized into `User/` and `Developer/` subdirectories for clearer navigation.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed axis parameter name in sustained demo**: `game-controller-sustained-demo.json` used incorrect parameter `"AxisName"` instead of `"Axis"` in 4 locations, causing axis mappings to silently fall back to defaults.
