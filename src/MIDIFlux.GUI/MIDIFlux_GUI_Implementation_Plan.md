   - [x] Create CC Range Mapping editor
   - [x] Implement Game Controller Mapping editor
   - [x] Create Macro Mapping editor
   - [x] Add anti-recursion protection for macros

4. **Live Preview Mode**
   - [x] Implement temporary configuration saving
   - [x] Create status pane for preview events
   - [x] Add preview mode toggle
   - [x] Implement cleanup for preview mode

## Phase 4: MIDI Detection & Settings

1. **MIDI Input Detection**
   - [x] Create MIDI monitor interface
   - [x] Implement device selector
   - [x] Add real-time MIDI message display
   - [x] Implement flood control for rapid events
   - [x] Create "Copy to Mapping" functionality

2. **Settings Control**
   - [x] Implement general settings section
   - [x] Create logging settings section
   - [x] Add advanced settings section
   - [x] Implement settings persistence

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing

1. **System Tray Integration**
   - [x] Extend existing system tray functionality
   - [x] Add GUI open option to tray menu
   - [x] Implement minimize to tray behavior

2. **Thread Safety Testing**
   - [ ] Create automated tests for UI thread safety
   - [ ] Implement stress tests for MIDI event handling
   - [ ] Test UI responsiveness under load

3. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - [ ] Add keyboard navigation to all controls
   - [ ] Implement screen reader support
   - [ ] Test focus management

4. **Final Integration**
   - [ ] Connect all components to main application
   - [ ] Ensure proper startup/shutdown sequence
   - [ ] Implement configuration migration if needed

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Basic Framework
Start by implementing the main form and tab container, along with the system tray integration. This provides the foundation for all other components.

### Step 2: Profile Management
Implement the Profile Manager control first, as it's the entry point for the user. This includes the ability to create, load, and save profiles.

### Step 3: Device Configuration
Add the Profile Editor control with device configuration capabilities. This allows users to set up MIDI devices before creating mappings.

### Step 4: Mapping Editors
Implement the various mapping editors one by one, starting with the most basic (Key Mapping) and progressing to more complex ones (Macro, Game Controller).

### Step 5: MIDI Detection
Add the MIDI Input Detection control to help users identify MIDI inputs for mapping.

### Step 6: Settings
Implement the Settings control for global application configuration.

### Step 7: Live Preview
Add the Live Preview functionality to allow users to test their configurations in real-time.

### Step 8: Polish & Testing
Finalize the implementation with thorough testing, accessibility improvements, and UI polish.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Keep UI logic separate from business logic
   - Use proper MVVM or MVP patterns where appropriate
   - Ensure testability of all components

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Provide clear error messages to users
   - Prevent data loss due to errors

3. **Performance**
   - Ensure UI remains responsive during MIDI processing
   - Implement proper thread synchronization
   - Optimize resource usage for large configurations

4. **Accessibility**
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
   - Test with keyboard navigation
   - Ensure screen reader compatibility

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain compatibility with existing configuration files
   - Implement graceful handling of unknown configuration elements
   - Provide migration path for older configurations if needed
