> **üöß Alpha Release** - MIDIFlux is currently in alpha development. While functional, expect some rough edges and potential breaking changes between versions.

MIDIFlux is a powerful Windows application that transforms MIDI input devices into versatile computer controllers. Connect any MIDI device‚Äîfoot pedals, keyboards, control surfaces, or custom controllers‚Äîand map them to keyboard shortcuts, mouse actions, system controls, game controller inputs, and more.

## Quick Start

1. **Download the latest release**: [MIDIFlux Latest Release](https://github.com/Cozmopolit/MIDIFlux/releases/latest)
2. **Run the executable** - No installation required!
3. **Find MIDIFlux in your system tray** and load an example profile to get started

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see the [Installation & Usage](#installation--usage) section below.

### üéØ What MIDIFlux Does

MIDIFlux captures MIDI events from connected devices and translates them into a wide range of computer actions:

- **‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts**: Map MIDI notes/controls to any key combination
- **üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Control**: Control mouse movement, clicks, and scroll wheel
- **üéÆ Game Controllers**: Emulate Xbox controllers for gaming (via ViGEm)
- **üéµ Media Controls**: Play/pause, track navigation via media keys
- **üîä Audio Playback**: Trigger sound effects and audio samples
- **üíª System Commands**: Execute shell commands and scripts
- **üîÑ Advanced Actions**: Conditional logic, sequences, and complex macros

Perfect for musicians, streamers, presenters, gamers, and power users who want to create custom control setups using MIDI hardware.

- **Test Mode**: Monitor MIDI inputs without triggering keyboard events
- **Detailed Logging**: Console and file-based logging for debugging
- **Relative Controls**: Support for jog wheels and other relative controls
- **Game Controller Integration**: Map MIDI controls to Xbox controller inputs (requires ViGEm)
- **Mouse Wheel Control**: Control mouse scroll wheel with MIDI jog wheels

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (x64)
- **Hardware**: One or more MIDI input devices
- **Dependencies**: None! (All .NET dependencies are included in the executable)
- **Optional**: ViGEm Bus Driver (only required for game controller emulation features)

## Installation & Usage

### üöÄ Using the Release Executable (Recommended)

1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Cozmopolit/MIDIFlux/releases)
2. **Extract** the executable to any folder (it's portable!)
3. **Run** the downloaded executable (e.g., `MIDIFlux-v0.8-alpha-win-x64.exe`)
4. **Look for the MIDIFlux icon** in your system tray
5. **Right-click the tray icon** to access the menu

### üìÅ Configuration Files

MIDIFlux automatically creates example configuration files on first run:

**Location**: `%AppData%\MIDIFlux\profiles\examples\`

**Available Examples**:
- `basic-keyboard-shortcuts.json`: Basic keyboard shortcuts
- `game-controller-demo.json`: Game controller emulation
- `system-controls.json`: Media controls (play/pause, track navigation via media keys)

### üéÆ Loading a Profile

1. **Right-click** the system tray icon
2. **Select "Load Profile"**
3. **Choose** an example profile to get started
4. **Connect your MIDI device** and start using it!

### üîß Configuration

The application uses JSON configuration files. Example configurations are located in `%AppData%\MIDIFlux\profiles\examples\`. Start with the provided examples and customize them for your needs.

For detailed documentation on configuration options, see the [Getting Started Guide](Documentation/GETTING_STARTED.md) and [Action Reference](Documentation/ACTION_REFERENCE.md).
